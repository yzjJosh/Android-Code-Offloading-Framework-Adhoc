In our project, we plan to migrate some method execution to other Android devices. In order to do so, we firstly need some mechanism to intercept method calls of Android application. This can be done using bytecode manipulation tools like Javaassist. The foundation of our project is to write a gradle plugin which is executed at build time and insert a piece of bytecode to target methods. The plugin can be written with the help of morpheus (https://github.com/stephanenicolas/morpheus). With the plugin in hand, we can allow developers to add annotations to methods which are intended to be migrated. Then our plugin will recognize these annotations and modify these methods.

The next challenge is how to handle the migration process. Our plan is sending the invoking object, method name, and parameters to the receiver, then let the receiver execute the method, then return back the return value together with these modified objects. We also need a server APP which is pre-installed in the peer Android devices to receive these objects and execute the code. Also there are a lot of other concerns like how to handle load balancing and how to handle failures. These aspects are still to be determined.
