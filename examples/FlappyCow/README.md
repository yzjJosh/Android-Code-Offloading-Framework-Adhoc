**Flappy Cow** is an Android game in "Flappy Bird" Style. Since Nguyen Ha Dong, the developer of "Flappy Bird", anounced [the end](http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/02/08/flappy-bird-creator-says-hes-taking-the-game-down/) of his loved but also hated game I uploaded this Open Source game, so you have an alternative to fulfill your addiction.

Initially called Flappy Cow, it has now(v.1.83) been renamed to *FlutterCow* because of [Googles policy on the word *Flappy* in app names](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/17/tech/mobile/flappy-apps-banned/)
