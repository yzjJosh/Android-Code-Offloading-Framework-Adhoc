1. Add user interface to the server app to display the server status and events. Enable user to control the server app easily (turn on or turn off easily)

2. Enable Code offloading on more than one devices (2 or 3 servers).

3. Figure out how to dynamically discover servers. When the server is not available at the beginning, but it starts afterwards, our framework should make the new server join its computations.

4. Modify example apps so that they can compute on more than one phones.
