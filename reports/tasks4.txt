1. Figure out the best way to balance loads. If there are multiple devices that can provide computation, we should make their load as balancing as possible to maximize performance.

2. Figure out the best way to handle failures. Failures including connection lost or crashing. In case of failure the application should work correctly, even though there may be performance penalty.

3. Test the example apps on the load balancing and failure handling perspectives.
